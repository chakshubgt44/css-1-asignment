        <ul class="letterspace">
            <li>Inline- by using the style attribute inside HTML elements1</li>
            <li>Internal- by using a style elemnt in the head section</li>
            <li>External- by using a link element tyo link to an external CSS file.</li>
            <li>The most common way to add CSS. is to keep the styles in external CSS files. how ever, <span
                    class="em">in this
                    tutitorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span> because this is easier to demonstrate,and
                easier for you to try it yourself.

    <div class="paragraph"><p>When comparing CSS class vs ID,the differnce is that CSS class applies a style to multiple
        elements.ID, on the other hand,applies a style to one unique element.ID is also special in that you can use a
        special URL.to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaSript. <br><br><br>
        In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a webpage.Once an element has
        been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the elements. <br> <br><br>
        There is a wide range of selectors avialable.Two of the most commonly used are class and ID.Both are used to
        target elements to which a style should be applied. </p>
